ðŸŸ¡ What is a Canary Deployment?

Deploying a new version (v2) to a small subset of users/traffic first, while most users get the stable version (v1).
Monitor metrics/traces; if no errors, gradually shift more traffic to v2 until itâ€™s 100%.
If errors spike, INSTANT rollback to v1â€”no drama, no downtime.
